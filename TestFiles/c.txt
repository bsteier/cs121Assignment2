Contractions are a common feature of the English language that are created by combining two words into one. Contractions allow us to communicate more efficiently by shortening longer phrases, and they are used in both spoken and written language. For example, 
"I am" becomes "I'm," "cannot" becomes "can't,"
 and "they will" becomes "they'll."

 Contractions are a useful tool for adding emphasis and conveying tone in writing. They can help to create a more conversational and informal tone, which is especially useful in personal writing such as emails and letters. Additionally, using contractions can make writing feel more approachable and relatable to readers. However, it is important to note that in formal writing, such as academic papers and business reports, the 
 use of contractions may not be appropriate.

While contractions are widely used in spoken and
 informal written language, it is important to use them judiciously. Overusing 
 contractions can make writing feel overly casual or even sloppy. Additionally, it's important 
 to be aware of the appropriate situations in which to use contractions, as they may not always be
  appropriate or effective. In general, it is best to match the level of formality in your writing 
  to the situation and audience, and to use contractions sparingly in more formal contexts.
